# Akkatecture

Akkatecture is a cqrs and event sourcing framework for akka.net. Fully optimised around using akkas non-thread-blocking message passing and event stream pub sub mechanism for event propagation. All in .net core (targeting netstandard 2.0).

Go ahead and take a look at [our documentation](http://akkatecture.net/docs/getting-started), go over [some concepts](http://akkatecture.net/docs/primitives), and read the [tips and tricks](http://akkatecture.net/docs/tips-and-tricks).


### Features

* **Distributed:** Backed by akka.net's actor model. Akkatecture enjoys the benefits of a good distributed computing computation model.
* **Message based:** Making it highly scalable by being reactive from message passing, Akkatecture [does not ask, it tells](http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/dont-ask-tell-2/).
* **Event sourced:** By design, aggregate roots derive their state by replaying persisted events.
* **Highly scalable:** Work proceeds interactively and concurrently, overlapping in time.
* **Configurable:** Through akka.net's hocon configuration, you will be able to configure every aspect of your application.

### Examples

Akkatecture comes with a few examples on how to best use it:

* **[Simple](https://github.com/Lutando/Akkatecture/tree/master/examples/simple):** A simple console based example that shows the most simple example of how to create an aggregate and issue commands to it.

* **[Walkthrough](https://github.com/Lutando/Akkatecture/tree/master/examples/walkthrough):** Tutorial style sample based on the walkthrough in the Akkatecture documentation. The walkthrough proposes domain that should be modelled based on some business requirements. The walkthrough goes step by step covering all the primitives and features covered in Akkatecture to give you an understanding of the framework. The beginning of the walkthrough in the documentation can be found [here](https://akkatecture.net/docs/walkthrough-introduction).


* **[Cluster](https://github.com/Lutando/Akkatecture/tree/master/examples/cluster):** A more involved sample that shows you how to do distributed aggregates using clustering. Read the [readme](https://github.com/Lutando/Akkatecture/tree/master/examples/cluster/README.md) for the sample for a good overview of the example.

* **[Web](https://github.com/Lutando/Akkatecture/tree/master/examples/web):** This sample shows how to integrate akka into an aspnet core project, specifically how to inject actor references when using akkatecture. Furthermore this project models a long running process that might be run behind a web application or something similar. Read the [readme](https://github.com/Lutando/Akkatecture/tree/master/examples/web/README.md) for more detailed information about the example.

* **[Tests](https://github.com/Lutando/Akkatecture/tree/master/test/Akkatecture.TestHelpers/Aggregates):** The test examples found in the Akkatecture.TestHelpers project is there to provide assistance when doing testing for Akkatecture. There is a simple domain modelled that includes an aggregate with a simple aggregate saga, and these are used to do simple black box style testing on Akkatecture using akka.net's TestKit.


**Note:** This example is part of the Akkatecture simple example project, so checkout [the
code](https://github.com/Lutando/Akkatecture/blob/master/examples/simple/Akkatecture.Examples.Application/Program.cs#L13) and give it a run.
```csharp
//Create actor system
var system = ActorSystem.Create("useraccount-example");

//Create supervising aggregate manager for UserAccount aggregate root actors
var aggregateManager = system.ActorOf(Props.Create(() => new UserAccountAggregateManager()));

//Build create user account aggregate command with name "foo bar"
var aggregateId = UserAccountId.New;
var createUserAccountCommand = new CreateUserAccountCommand(aggregateId, "foo bar");
            
//Send command, this is equivalent to command.publish() in other cqrs frameworks
aggregateManager.Tell(createUserAccountCommand);
            
//tell the aggregateManager to change the name of the aggregate root to "foo bar baz"
var changeNameCommand = new UserAccountChangeNameCommand(aggregateId, "foo bar baz");
aggregateManager.Tell(changeNameCommand);
```

### Assumptions About Akkatecture Developers

It would be ideal if you have some expirience in domain driven design, cqrs, and event sourcing.
It would also be beneficial for you to be familiar with actor systems, akka.net, and the extensibility points that akka gives you through hocon configuration. However, if you follow the [walkthrough](https://akkatecture.net/docs/walkthrough-introduction) you will be acquinted with many akka.net concepts.

### Status of Akkatecture

Akkatecture is still in development. The goal of this projects first version is to provide you with the neccassary building blocks to build out your own cqrs and event sourced application without having to think of the primitives.

akkatecture is currently missing these crucial features:
- aggregate state snapshotting.
- schedueled jobs.

### Contributing

Akkatecture's documentation source is [here](https://github.com/Akkatecture/Documentation), if you have any suggestions or improvements that can be made to them.

### Useful Resources

There are many different opinions and best practices when it comes to building out ddd based solutions. Here are a few articles and resources that can give you a good foundational grounding on the concepts used extensively in this project.

## Motivations

Doing domain driven design in a distributed scenario is quite tricky. And even more so when you add cqrs and event sourcing style mechanics to your business domain. Akka gives you powerful ways to co-ordinate and organise your business rules by using actors and message passing, which can be done by sending messages through location transparent addresses (or references). The major benefits of using akka.net is that we can isolate our domain models into actors where it makes sense.

Akkatecture gives you a set of opinionated generic constructs that you can use to wire up your application so that you can focus on your main task, modelling and codifying your business domain.

Akka.net gives us a wealth of good APIs out of the box that can be used to build entire systems out of. It also has a decent ecosystem and [community](https://gitter.im/akkadotnet/akka.net) for support. Akkatecture is also of the opinion that commands translate well semantically in actor systems since telling commands is a form of message passing that fits well into the actor model paradigm.
